# crawl deep and unique links

csefo crawling and spidering and vulnerability checks (e.g. XSS, open redirect, etc)


    Deep crawling – now the crawler will follow all internal links recursively and deeply.
    Vulnerability scanning – simple checks like XSS, open redirects, and SQL injection.
    Threading – will speed up the crawl by processing multiple links concurrently.
    Depth limit toggle – allows you to control the depth of the crawl.
    TXT output – logs the results into a .txt file for easy analysis.
